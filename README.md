UserSpectre is a fast and concurrent username reconnaissance tool written in Python. It checks the availability or presence of a username across multiple websites, saving the results for further analysis.

---

## Features

- Concurrent scanning with configurable thread count
- Supports multiple site configuration JSON files
- Color-coded terminal output (using `colorama`)
- Saves results in JSON and TXT formats under a `scan` directory
- Can be run standalone or invoked programmatically from another Python script

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher  
- Dependencies:
  
  A `requirements.txt` file is included for easy installation of dependencies. To install all required packages, run:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* The `requirements.txt` should contain:

  ```
  requests
  colorama
  ```

---

## Usage

### Run standalone

```bash
python3 UserSpectre.py --username <username> --sites sites.json --workers 25
```

* `--username` â€” Username to search (prompts if not given)
* `--sites` â€” One or more JSON files with site URLs (default: `sites.json`)
* `--workers` â€” Number of concurrent threads (default: 25)

### Run via start script

Edit `start.py` to set parameters:

```python
from UserSpectre import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    username = "exampleuser"
    sites_files = ["sites.json"]
    workers = 25

    main(username, sites_files, workers)
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 start.py
```

## Sites JSON Format

Each site entry should have:

* `name`: Friendly site name
* `url`: URL with `{}` as placeholder for the username
* Optional `error_type`: `"status_code"` or `"keyword"`
* Optional `error_msg`: Keyword indicating username absence if `error_type` is `"keyword"`

Example `sites.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "GitHub",
    "url": "https://github.com/{}",
    "error_type": "status_code"
  },
  {
    "name": "Twitter",
    "url": "https://twitter.com/{}",
    "error_type": "keyword",
    "error_msg": "page not found"
  }
]
```

---

## Output

* Results saved in the `scan/` directory as:

  * `<username>_result.json` â€” JSON summary of found usernames
  * `<username>_result.txt` â€” Plain text summary of found usernames

* Console output colors:

  * **Green**: Username found
  * **Red**: Username not found
  * **Yellow**: Errors (timeouts, connection issues)
